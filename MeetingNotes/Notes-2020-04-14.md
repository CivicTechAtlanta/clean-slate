# Process
1. GJP provides registration template & basic instructions to summit sponsor
1. Summit sponsor creates registration form by importing the template and then customizes form to meet their specific needs (e.g. set county branding, remove unnecessary fields)
  - Code For Atlanta #clean-slate team (lead: Shaun Mosley) can support this effort
1. Sponsor publishes registration form with application deadline prior to summit.
1. Applicants (people wanting to have their records expunged) fill out the registration form online. When application form is submitted, it gets automatically sent to the lead for the summit in that county/jurisdiction (can be prosecutor, clerk, or someone else)
1. Prosecutor receives form prior to summit and does necessary research/analysis
1. Prosecutors provide the results of a person's restriction application but they don't meet with the applicant.  On day of summit, GJP attorneys or trained volunteers meet with applicant to go over their info - consult with people about what the prosecutor was able to restrict / not restrict.

# Assumptions
* Some summits can have 2 or more circuits
* We aren’t building software to do the actual restriction ? application form that goes on a website (e.g. GJP website, by county)
* Current process: summit attendee fills out a paper form before attending a summit, and brings the form to a summit.  Representative from Solicitor’s office (i.e. Prosecutor) enters the data from the form into <insert system name here>
* Paperless (no printing, no mailing)

# Needs
* Create form like the one used by Office of Fulton County Solicitors-General (link)
* Find all possible fields needed for every county (i.e. superset), and let counties pick from that menu

# Terms
* Expungement = colloquial term (technically don’t have that)
* Different codes
    * Dispositions
    * Not Guilty
    * Guilty
    * Null Process (decline to prosecute)
    * Hung Jury
* Systems
    * GCIC (	GBI, Centralized database for whole state)

# Random Notes
* Smaller County (e.g. Talcott County)
	public record
	no uniform system / process

Juvenile records have higher levels of protection

# Process
## Sealing: Courthouses
1. File motion to seal
1. Judge signs off
## Restricting: GCIC
1. Fill out application & pay fee to arresting agency
1. Arresting agency pulls record & get the dispositions (if missing)
1. Submit to Prosecutor to determine eligibility
1. (sometimes) restrict through own access to GCIC database
1. (sometimes) pay $25 to get

3 page application

Timeline
	July 1, 2013 and before
	July 2, 2013 and after & no conviction - automatically restricted when dismissed



# Raw notes
- Rather than having people wait hours to get help, speeding it up with 
- The applications will have Personal Information on it - there’s always security concerns for them
- Summits can be by counties or Judicial circuits
- Some summits have had 2 circuits
- Is it the exact same form in all of the summits?
- If you have arrests in Dekalb, Chatham, and Fulton, you have to apply 3 times
- Other counties did not like that some of the forms b/c it had other county names on it
- ABA Prosecutorial site
- Need to get prosecutorial buy-in
- You can’t have a summit without prosecutors buying in to it.
- Some prosecutors want to do this
- 1 form from GJP
- We’re trying to avoid printing; want it to go electronically
- We can host it on GJP, then direct it to the prosecutor
- Prosecutors are going to request that it’s super secure (and match their system)
- Who’s responsible for the data?
- That legal req’t is such a hard barrier to overcome
- Something easily set up and used by other vendors
- JotForm used by Fulton County and HIPAA compliant
- We can build a template in JotForm that others can use; that’s legally-approved
- The online form is for the county to be informed
- Digitizing the process of restrictions (at least for summits)
- For each county, which & how many prosecutors need to be informed?
- Fulton: DA & Solicitor
- Sometimes there are 2 or more staff in the office that handle it	
- When approaching counties for expungement, what’s that like?
- Most counties reach out to GJP to start the Summits
- Next Summit is April 29
- Access to Justice committee by the state bar

# Action items
- Shaun: Make a JotForm to test
- Ann: Check with Fulton County to get context behind

# Future steps:
- Test the JotForm as a prototype with prosecutors (what are your thoughts? Is this missing anything? etc)
- A future summit can be the pilot for this process
