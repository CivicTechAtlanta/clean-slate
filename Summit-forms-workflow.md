# Process

**Notes:**
- "GJP" is Georgia Justice Project
- "Clean-Slate Team" is the team of volunteers with Code-for-Atlanta assisting by GJP by defining/documenting use of JotForm to assist in summit applications.
- "Summit Admin" is administrator associated with local summit jurisdiction 


## Step 1 - Template Creation

### Clean-Slate Team | Create template
- Clean-Slate Team creates master template (with help from GJP Admin)
- This form should be a superset form, containing any fields required for any jurisdictions.
- GJP creates JotForm account
- Form imported into to GJP JotForm account

### Clean-Slate Team | Define process workflow
- Clean-Slate Team defines process workflow (this document)


## Step 2 - Summit Planning

### Create JotForm account for summit
- Each summit will have it's own JotForm account
- Based on the available technical resources in the jurisdiction, this may be done by either the GJP Admin or the Summit Admin.
- (Optional/As needed) GJP Admin provides Summit Admin & Prosecutor(s) any needed instructions/training for accessing JotForm account.
- Once JotForm account created, the master template (supplied by GJP Admin) will be used to create a summit specific (application) form.

### Summit Admin | Customize summit form
- Summit Admin logs into summit JotForm account and customizes summit form to meet jurisdiction needs.


## Step 3 - Summit Prep

### Summit Admin | Publicize form 
- Once summit form is ready, the summit admin publishes the URL link to the summit application form using whatever is best means for reaching potential attendees.
  - Social media
  - Flyers
  - E-Mail
  - Website

### Attendee | Fill out & submit application
- Prospective attendees follow publicized link to the summit application form & fill it out.  
- When they submit it, their response is automatically saved to the summit JotForm account

### Prosecutor | Review applications
- Local jurisdiction prosecutors log into the summit JotForm account to obtain a list of submitted applications
- After downloading applications, they review & process them, producing record restriction results.


## Step 4 - Day of Summit

### Attendee | Receives record restriction results
- After signing in at summit, attendee receives their record restriction results

### Attendee, GJP, Attorney | Q&A, Consultations
- Attendee then reviews the record restriction results with volunteer from GJP and/or volunteer attorney
